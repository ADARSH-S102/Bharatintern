üé§ Pulse Project ‚Äì Final 10-Minute Speech (with shorter Ansible part)

> Good morning everyone,

First of all, I‚Äôd like to thank my mentor and the entire team for giving me this wonderful opportunity to work on the Pulse project. It has been a great learning experience, especially in the areas of automation, monitoring, and DevOps integration. I‚Äôm really grateful for the continuous support and guidance throughout this journey.

Let me walk you through the Pulse project ‚Äî covering its objective, the solution, my contributions, the benefits, current status, and the next steps ahead.

Objective / Problem Statement
The Pulse project was developed as part of the TPLM Pinject initiative, to create a single platform that could monitor and manage multiple TPLM application services efficiently.

Earlier, many of these services used to go down after weekend patching, and teams had to restart them manually every Monday morning. There was no unified dashboard to check real-time service status, no proper monitoring for DPG services, and the Fenergo access process was completely manual.

To solve all these problems, we conceptualized and built Pulse ‚Äî a unified, automated, and configuration-driven dashboard.

Solution Overview
Pulse was developed using the Agile methodology, allowing us to continuously enhance features and deliver in short sprints.

The application is deployed on one of our servers, and an AVI Load Balancer is configured on top of it, with the REFWEB URL mapped for access.

To access Pulse, users simply open the URL in a browser and log in with admin credentials. Once logged in, they see a dashboard listing all the monitored applications and their corresponding environments.

Each environment has its own server, and Pulse displays the status of each service as UP, DOWN, or UNKNOWN.

Users can manually restart any service directly from the dashboard through a simple Restart button.

When a restart is triggered, the request goes from the Ansible master node to the respective Ansible worker node for that application. This allows services to be restarted remotely and securely without manual intervention.

Hovering over a service status also displays additional details like the last status check time and current state, ensuring near real-time visibility.

The dashboard itself is fully configuration-driven ‚Äî nothing is hardcoded. Any updates made in the configuration files are automatically reflected in the UI.

Authentication between Ansible and remote servers is managed securely using CyberArk, ensuring proper access control.

Apart from the health monitoring capability, Pulse also hosts two key utilities:

DPG Monitoring, which provides real-time visibility into the Data Provider Gateway endpoints.

Fenergo Access Utility, which helps grant access to the Fenergo application by directly connecting to the database and performing the required SQL operations based on user input.


Role of Ansible (Shortened)
Ansible acts as the automation engine behind Pulse. It handles all service restart operations ‚Äî both scheduled and manual ‚Äî across different servers.
Whenever a user clicks ‚ÄúRestart,‚Äù Pulse triggers the relevant Ansible playbook to perform the restart remotely and consistently.

This integration ensures faster recovery, less manual work, and consistent results across all environments.

Benefits and Impact

Pulse automatically detects service downtimes, generates alerts, and displays them in real time.

Every Monday morning, it automatically restarts services that are down due to patching.

Users can restart any service manually from the dashboard.

It is multi-threaded and configuration-driven, so any updates are instantly reflected in the UI.

Overall, it has significantly reduced downtime, improved visibility, and increased operational efficiency.


Current Status
Pulse is now live and actively monitoring all non-production environments of TPLM applications.

The Ansible farm is fully set up for all TPLM applications, allowing automated remediation of application flow issues.

Pulse also hosts DPG service monitoring and Fenergo access management.

We‚Äôve implemented a dedicated CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment of new updates and configurations.

Next Steps
As part of the roadmap, the following enhancements are planned:

1. Pulse User Access ‚Äì Introducing SSO and local authentication.


2. Fenergo Sanity Integration ‚Äì To perform health checks directly through Pulse.


3. Grafana Integration ‚Äì To display CPU and memory utilization metrics.


4. Apigee Integration ‚Äì To restart VDB services through IV2 APIs.


5. RM Pipeline Integration ‚Äì With Elastic DB for richer data insights.


6. DevOps KPI Management ‚Äì To track and measure defined performance metrics.



Conclusion
To summarize, Pulse has become a centralized, intelligent platform that not only monitors applications but also takes automated corrective actions when needed.

It has streamlined service monitoring, reduced downtime, and greatly improved overall productivity.

Once again, I would like to thank my mentor and team for their constant support and for giving me the opportunity to contribute to such an impactful project. Thank you.

Sure! Below is a complete working example of a **Spring Boot + Thymeleaf** application that:

* Parses a YAML file.
* Displays each `applicationComponent` as a **tab**.
* Shows related data under each tab in a **table format**.
